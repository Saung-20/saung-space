<h2>Professional Experiences</h2>

<!-- FREELANCE TUTOR -->
<div class="experience-block">
  <h3>Freelance Tutor (2019–2023)</h3>

  <p>
    In 2019, I successfully passed my matriculation examination with four distinctions
    in English, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. Following the completion of my
    matriculation studies, I began working as a freelance tutor, where I supported
    junior students in their preparation for the matriculation examination.
  </p>

  <p>
    I assisted students in strengthening their academic foundations, developing
    effective study strategies, and approaching examinations with greater confidence.
    In parallel, I also worked as a freelance English teacher, independently organizing
    and conducting classes focused on writing, reading comprehension, and grammar.
  </p>

  <p>
    These roles marked my first professional experience and first opportunity for
    financial and professional independence, strengthening my self-confidence,
    responsibility, and commitment to education.

  <h3>English Teacher (2021–2023)</h3>
  <h4>JUMP*START KIDs School</h4>

  <p>
    While working as a freelance teacher, I was offered a position as an English Teacher
    at one of the leading preschools in my hometown, an institution established for over
    two decades. This role provided valuable professional workplace experience and
    strengthened a wide range of soft skills.
  </p>

    I worked closely with a team of educators and regularly communicated with parents,
    discussing students’ progress and addressing learning needs. Bi-monthly meetings
    required analytical and critical thinking as teaching strategies were reviewed and
    refined collaboratively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond classroom responsibilities, I actively participated in planning and executing
    cultural, seasonal, and festival events, contributing from initial planning to
    detailed execution.
